# üìù Portfolio Blog Backend

Portfolio Blog Backend is a Node.js/Express application that serves as the backend for a blogging platform. It uses MongoDB as the database and implements authentication using JWT tokens.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you get started, you will need to have the following installed on your machine:

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- MongoDB (v4.2 or higher)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository using Git:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pratikneupane/portfolio-blog-backend.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd portfolio-blog-backend
   ```

3. Install the dependencies using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Configuration

The application requires a `.env` file to be present in the root directory. You can copy the `.env.example` file and modify it according to your needs:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

You should update the `MONGODB_URI` variable to point to your MongoDB instance.

### Running the Application

To start the application, run:

```bash
npm start
```

The application should now be running on `http://localhost:5000`.

## üîë Authentication

The application uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication. To obtain a JWT token, you will need to make a `POST` request to `/login` with valid credentials. The response will contain a token that you can use for subsequent requests that require authentication.
